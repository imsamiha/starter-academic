I am a PhD student who works as a teaching assistant for the Department of Mathematics at University of Texas Dallas. Currently, I am working on a paper called “Dynamics of SIR model with heterogeneous response to intervention policy” under the supervision of my advisor Dmitrii Rachinskii. Alongside that, I am teaching two review sessions a week to undergraduate students in linear algebra.

My research interest include dynamical systems, mathematical biology, image processing and machine learning. I enjoy developing numerical models and simulations to accompany my research and projects. Generally, I build my models in MATLAB but also have expertise in Python and Java.

Some of my notable work include two publications, two contributed talks, and a web article in SIAM news. Examples of my work are showcased in my portfolio below.

In between research and teaching you can find me spending time with my family, playing Breath of the Wild, or listening to podcasts.
