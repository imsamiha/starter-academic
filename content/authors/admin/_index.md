I have recently obtained my PhD in Applied Mathematics. My dissertation studied the dynamics of epidemiology models with switching transmission rate and vaccination rate characterized by a relay operator or Preisach operator.

My research interest include dynamical systems, mathematical biology, image processing and machine learning. I enjoy developing numerical models and simulations to accompany my research and projects. Generally, I build my models in MATLAB but also have expertise in Python and Java.

Some of my notable work include two publications, two contributed talks, and a web article in SIAM news. Examples of my work are showcased in my portfolio below.

I also enjoy teaching mathematics with 12+ of formal and informal teaching experience across multiple grade levels (8th grade to college undergraduates). Currently, I am teaching two review sessions a week to undergraduate students in linear algebra.

In between research and teaching you can find me spending time with my family, playing Breath of the Wild, or listening to podcasts.
