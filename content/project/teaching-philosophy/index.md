Many times a personâ€™s education is geared towards knowing facts rather than building real-world connections. So in no time they begin to question the purpose of their education. Therefore, I prioritize creating an environment that engages curiosity and promotes self-driven exploration. I want my students to go beyond understanding so that they can apply their knowledge across disciplines.

In order to achieve this, I incorporate thought-provoking examples, and physical or numerical models into my lessons. This ensures my students are exposed to multiple representation of every concepts. I break up my lessons into small parts to ask probing questions in-between to check their engagement and quickly assess their understanding. I also dedicate a portion of class time to allow them to attempt problems and discuss ideas among themselves. Not only does this encourage critical thinking but also results in them receiving useful feedback from both their fellow classmates and me. 

Furthermore, I regularly remind my students of my office hours and that I am open to appointments, if necessary. Also, I make a conscious effort to promptly respond to their emails and request. This way they do not hesitate to seek me out if they need extra support.

For me to be an effective educator, it is important that I create a welcoming atmosphere for my students and not alienate them from the learning experience. So I strive to provide them with a motivating experience so that they further their education with a positive outlook. Simultaneously, I accept the feedback I receive from them and make every effort to improve my teaching, hopefully exceeding expectations.
